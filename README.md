# **Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)**

This repository is a project for unsupervised learning, focusing on the implementation, parameter tuning, and comparison of Locally Linear Embedding with other dimensionality reduction techniques. Additionally, it introduces Isomap and LLE. The notebook includes examples of LLE applied to both image and text datasets.
